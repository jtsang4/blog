## 💻 Local Development

This project uses **pnpm** as the primary package manager (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
# Recommended
pnpm install

# You can also use npm / yarn if you prefer
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

By default, Astro runs on <http://localhost:4321>. If the port is changed, please refer to the logs in your terminal.

### 3. Build & preview

```bash
# Build production assets
pnpm build

# Preview the built site locally
pnpm preview
```

### 4. Linting & formatting

```bash
# Check formatting
pnpm format:check

# Auto‑format
pnpm format

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

Husky and lint‑staged are configured to run checks automatically before commits.

## 🌐 Deployment

The site is built as static assets with `astro build` and can be deployed to any static hosting or your own server, for example:

- Object storage + CDN
- Static hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.)
- Self‑hosted servers with Nginx / Caddy, and so on

Typical flow:

```bash
pnpm build
# The output will be in ./dist
```

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server or hosting provider. The production site for this repository is currently available at: <https://jtsang.me/>.

RSS feeds:

- `/rss.xml`
- `/feed` redirects to the RSS feed (configured in the `redirects` section of `astro.config.mjs`).

## ✍️ Writing & Content Conventions

- All posts live under `src/content/blog`.
- Astro Content Collections schemas in `src/content/_schemas.ts` are used to validate frontmatter.
- Each post typically includes frontmatter fields like: title, summary, publish date, language (optional), tags, etc.
- Posts can use:
  - Standard Markdown
  - Code blocks with Shiki highlighting
  - Mermaid diagrams (sequence diagrams, flowcharts, etc.) via custom remark plugins

## 🙏 Acknowledgements & Origins

This blog was originally bootstrapped from the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme, and then heavily customized and refactored to match my personal preferences for writing and structure.

If you are looking for a general‑purpose Astro blog theme, you can refer to the original AstroPaper project. If you are curious about how this site is set up, feel free to explore or reuse parts of this codebase.
