# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds all site code: `components/`, `layouts/`, `pages/`, `styles/`, `assets/`, `utils/`.
- Blog content lives in `src/content/blog/<slug>/index.md`, often with a `cover.*` image; schemas live in `src/content/_schemas.ts`.
- `public/` is for static assets copied as-is (favicons, robots.txt, client scripts).
- `astro.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.mjs`, and `tsconfig.json` define build and tooling behavior.
- `dist/` is the build output (generated by `astro build`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm install`: install dependencies (pnpm is the primary package manager).
- `pnpm dev`: start the local Astro dev server.
- `pnpm build`: create production assets in `dist/`.
- `pnpm preview`: serve the built site locally.
- `pnpm sync`: sync Astro types/content collections.
- `pnpm lint`: run Biome checks across the repo.
- `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:check`: format or verify formatting with Biome.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Formatting is enforced by Biome: 2-space indentation, no semicolons, 80-column width, LF line endings.
- Biome linting uses the recommended rules; keep Astro component scripts small and readable.
- Content is organized by slug folders under `src/content/blog/` with `index.md` as the entry file.

## Testing Guidelines
- There are no automated test suites in this repo right now.
- Use `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format:check` for quality gates and `pnpm preview` for manual verification.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent history follows Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `doc:`, `chore:`. Use `pnpm cz` if you want help composing messages.
- Husky runs `lint-staged` on pre-commit; keep changes clean and focused.
- PRs should include a short description, verification steps, and screenshots for UI/content changes when relevant.

## Configuration & Content Tips
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you add runtime configuration.
- Site-wide behavior (routes, markdown plugins, RSS, redirects) is centralized in `astro.config.mjs`.
